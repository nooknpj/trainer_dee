              Lately, more and more people are trying to take a better care of
              their health whether the goal is to lose weight, to get in shape
              or just to achieve a healthier life. And one of the most important
              factors that could help in achieving that is proper physical
              exercise. Proper physical exercise requires attention in many
              different aspects of our body, of which many people are not aware
              of or they are doing it wrong. So, it’s a good idea to get help
              from a personal trainer who could help and instruct a proper way
              to exercise that can be adjusted for each individual. But for
              people who don’t have a lot of connections with personal trainers,
              it could be hard to find one for them. So, we decided to create a
              match-maker platform where clients and trainers can contact each
              other.
